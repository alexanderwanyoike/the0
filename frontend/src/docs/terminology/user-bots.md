# User Bots

These are the bots that you installed from the marketplace. They are instances of Custom Bots that you have installed and can deploy on the platform. Once you buy a bot from the marketplace, it becomes available in you [My Bots](/user-bots) section of the platform. You can then deploy it and it becomes a [Bot](./bots). User Bots are managed through the platform and can be monitored, backtested\*, and deployed like any other Bot.

> Not all bots can be backtested. For example some DCA (dollar cost averaging) bots cannot be backtested as they are more suited for investing rather than trading. The marketplace will indicate which bots support backtesting and which do not.
