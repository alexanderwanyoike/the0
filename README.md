Get the0 running locally in under 5 minutes:

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** 20.10+ and **Docker Compose** 2.0+
- At least 4GB RAM available for containers
- **Git** for cloning the repository

### Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

the0 is built as a comprehensive microservices platform that enables algorithmic trading bot development and execution:

### How It Works

**üåê Web Dashboard** - Next.js frontend for bot management, real-time monitoring, and comprehensive documentation system

**üõ†Ô∏è CLI Tool** - Go-based command-line interface for local bot development, testing, and deployment automation

**üöÄ API Server** - NestJS backend providing REST APIs, JWT authentication, and event orchestration across all services

**‚öôÔ∏è Runtime Services** - Specialized Go microservices using master-worker patterns for different execution models:
- **Bot Runner**: Real-time trading bot execution
- **Backtest Runner**: Historical strategy validation  
- **Bot Scheduler**: Cron-based scheduled execution

**üîç Security Analyzer** - Python service with YARA rules for automated security analysis of user-submitted bot code

**ü§ñ AI Assistant** - FastAPI service providing AI-powered bot development assistance and code generation. Standalone application for now, but will be integrated into the frontend in the future.

**üíæ Data Architecture** - Multi-database approach:
- **PostgreSQL**: User accounts, bot definitions, authentication
- **MongoDB**: Runtime state, job queues, execution logs
- **MinIO**: Bot code storage, logs, backtest results
- **NATS JetStream**: Event streaming and service coordination

### Key Benefits

- **üîí Secure**: Each bot runs in isolation with basic security checks
- **‚ö° Fast**: Real-time execution with live market data
- **üìà Scalable**: Automatically handles multiple bots and users
- **üõ°Ô∏è Reliable**: Robust error handling and monitoring

## ü§ñ Bot Development

### Framework Agnostic Approach

the0 doesn't lock you into specific libraries or frameworks. Create bots using:

- **Python 3.11+** with any PyPI packages (pandas, numpy, ccxt, etc.)
- **JavaScript/Node.js 20+** with any npm packages
- **Open Standards**: YAML configuration, JSON Schema validation

### Example: Simple DCA Bot

```python
from typing import Dict, Any
from alpaca.trading.client import TradingClient

def main(id: str, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Dollar Cost Averaging bot - buys a fixed amount regularly"""
    
    # Initialize trading client
    client = TradingClient(
        api_key=config["api_key"],
        secret_key=config["secret_key"],
        paper=config.get("paper", True)
    )
    
    # Calculate and execute purchase
    symbol = config["symbol"]
    amount = config["amount"]
    
    # Place market buy order
    order = client.submit_order(
        symbol=symbol,
        notional=amount,
        side=OrderSide.BUY,
        type=OrderType.MARKET,
        time_in_force=TimeInForce.DAY
    )
    
    return {
        "status": "success",
        "message": f"Purchased ${amount} of {symbol}",
        "order_id": order.id
    }
```

### Bot Types

- **üìÖ Scheduled Bots** - Run on cron schedules (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **‚ö° Real-time Bots** - Continuous execution with live data feeds
