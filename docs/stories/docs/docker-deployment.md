# Docker Deployment Documentation Fix Story

## üìã Objective

Validate and correct the Docker Deployment documentation (`src/docs/platform-development-guide/infrastructure/docker-deployment.md`) to accurately reflect the actual Docker Compose configuration and local development setup for the0 platform.

- Development workflow and best practices
- Health checks and dependencies
- Troubleshooting common issues

- [ ] Document all environment variables
- [ ] Check default values
- [ ] Verify secrets management
- [ ] Document required vs optional vars

**Locations to check**:
- `docker/.env.example`
- `.env.example` files in service directories
- docker-compose.yml env_file directives

### 6. Build Configuration
- [ ] Verify Dockerfile locations for each service
- [ ] Check build contexts
- [ ] Document build arguments
- [ ] Verify BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE usage
- [ ] Check multi-stage builds

**Locations to check**:
- Dockerfile in each service directory
- Build sections in docker-compose.yml

### 7. Health Checks
- [ ] List services with health checks
- [ ] Verify health check commands
- [ ] Check intervals and timeouts
- [ ] Document retry logic
- [ ] Verify dependency waiting patterns

**Locations to check**:
- healthcheck sections in docker-compose.yml

### 8. Resource Limits
- [ ] Check CPU limits
- [ ] Verify memory limits
- [ ] Document resource reservations
- [ ] Check ulimits (if any)

**Locations to check**:
- deploy/resources sections in docker-compose.yml

### 9. Development Workflow
- [ ] Document startup commands
- [ ] Verify development scripts (Makefile, etc.)
- [ ] Check hot-reload configurations
- [ ] Document debugging setup
- [ ] Verify log access patterns

**Locations to check**:
- `docker/Makefile`
- `docker/scripts/`
- README or docs

### 10. Port Mappings
- [ ] Document all exposed ports
- [ ] Verify port conflicts
- [ ] Check for dynamic port allocation
- [ ] Document service access URLs

**Services to check**:
- Frontend (typically 3001)
- API (typically 3000)
- MinIO Console (typically 9001)
- MongoDB (if exposed)
- PostgreSQL (if exposed)
- Other services

## üêõ Known Issues to Address

### Issues Identified
1. **Service Count**: May not reflect actual number of services
2. **Generic Configuration**: Examples may be generic rather than actual
3. **Missing Services**: May not document all services in compose file
4. **Environment Variables**: May be incomplete or outdated
5. **Network Setup**: May not accurately describe networking
6. **Volume Persistence**: May not explain data persistence correctly
7. **Outdated Commands**: Development commands may be outdated

### Sections Needing Verification
- **Service list**: Update with all actual services
- **Environment variables**: Document all required vars
- **Network configuration**: Verify actual network setup
- **Volume mappings**: Document all volumes and their purposes
- **Port mappings**: List all exposed ports
- **Build process**: Document actual build steps
- **Development workflow**: Update with current commands

## üìù Tasks to Complete

### Phase 1: Codebase Analysis
1. Locate docker-compose.yml file
2. Count and list all services
3. Document each service configuration
4. Review network definitions
5. Document volume mappings
6. Review environment configurations
7. Check Dockerfiles for each service
8. Document health checks
9. Review development scripts (Makefile, etc.)

### Phase 2: Documentation Updates
