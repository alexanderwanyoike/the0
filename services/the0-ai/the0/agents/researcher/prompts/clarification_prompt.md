**CURRENT STEP: Clarification Phase.**

Before creating a research plan, ask the user 2-4 clarifying questions to better aid in the research process:
- The specific aspects they're most interested in
- Any specific constraints or focus areas
- Time period or market context if relevant

Keep questions concise and relevant. DO NOT call any tools yet.
